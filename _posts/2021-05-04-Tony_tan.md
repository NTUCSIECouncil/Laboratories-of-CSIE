- 訪談者：張志謙

筆者注：教授比較習慣說英文，所以訪談是用英文進行的，下方有筆者的中文翻譯。

## What do you research?
Satisfiability of various logic, especially non-deterministic exponential time.

## What personality traits or ability do you hope to see on students?
Good attitude, and they are confitable with mathematics, in general. Not afraid of thinking.

## Do you assign research topic?
I assign the research topic. It's very important in the begining they are told what to do, or else they don't know what to do. But after all if they have their own idea, of course they can do what they want if it's promising.

## What do you expect students to done when studying special project?
Be professional, I don't expect them to publish paper or what. Reaearch as a student should be taken as an experience of learning. So professionalism is the most important thing.

## How much time do your students have to spend on special project?
Depends on them, it's not fixed of course. They try their best, I accept.

## Why special project is important to bachelor students?
Then they know how to be independent, it's a training. When they go out to work or continue doing research, it's not good just being told what to do, but they have to be independent also. 

## When should students start special projects?
As soon as they can.

## Can you give some suggestions to those who havn't know what do they want to do?
Read more, learn more. Then you know more, and you'll know what you want to do. The more you know, the more you sure what you want to do.

## What should a student do if he notice he doesn't like his current reasearch area?
Just go, it's ok. And find something he likes doing it.

## Do you mind student do multiple special project in the same time?
I don't mind, but too many is no good, you know. Time is limit, energe is limited. It's better to do one thing good than do many thing bad.

## 請問教授的實驗室的研究領域是什麼？
各種邏輯的可滿足性問題，特別是某些N-EXP的問題。

## 請問教授希望自己的專題生具備什麼特質或能力？
態度良好，整體而言對數學不反感，不害怕思考

## 請問教授會指定研究主題嗎？
我會指定，不然他們會不知道要做什麼，但如果他們有自己的想法，當然可以做他們想做的事。

## 請問教授對於專題生有什麼樣的期望？
我不期望他們發論文之類的，作為學生做研究是一種學習。所以學習專業精神是最重要的事。

## 請問待在教授實驗室的大學部學生一週大約得花多少時間在專題研究上？
這要看他們，他們盡其所能，我接受結果。

## 請問教授認為為何專題對資訊系學生是必要的？
訓練他們獨立，不管是要進入業界或做研究，只聽別人告訴你做什麼是不好的。

## 請問教授會建議學生們什麼時候開始接觸專題呢？
當他們準備好時。

## 請問教授對於還沒非常了解自己興趣的同學在選擇實驗室的方面有什麼樣的建議？
讀更多，學更多。知道的越多，就越確定自己喜歡什麼。

## 請問教授，成為專題生之後，如果發現研究主題和自己的興趣不合時，該怎麼辦呢？
就離開，去找他喜歡做的事。

## 請問若已經加入別的教授的實驗室，可以再跟教授做專題嗎？
我不會介意，但太多是不好的。做好一件事要比做壞很多事來的好
